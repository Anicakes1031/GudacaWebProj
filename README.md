# Gudaca Web

**Gudaca Web** is the very first website I created back when I was in my third year of college. It was a simple project built using basic HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. This project marked the beginning of my journey into web development.

## 📌 Features

- Simple and straightforward layout
- Basic structure using HTML and CSS
- Some interactive elements using vanilla JavaScript
- Served as my hands-on practice in building web pages from scratch

## ⚠️ Limitations

Since this was my first project:
- It’s **not fully responsive** on mobile or tablet devices
- The design is **not highly aesthetic** or modern
- The code may have **unoptimized parts** and lacks structure
- It's a **static** website with no backend or database

## 💡 Future Improvements

If I revisit this project in the future, I plan to:
- Make it fully **responsive** using media queries
- Clean up and organize the code better
- Use modern CSS frameworks like **Bootstrap** or **Tailwind CSS**
- Possibly integrate a backend for more functionality

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript
